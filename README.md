# Cyber Brista
Many people love coffee. They enjoy to be energized by the effect of caffeine and the joyful scent of mixture of milk and espresso. But loving drinking coffee doesnâ€™t mean one have the expertise on choosing qualified coffee beans. We aim to develop our Cyber Barista, a customer-oriented, regression model featuring predicting quality scores of coffee beans based on limited information. By mentioning limited information we want to emphasize that even a customer who can only recognize information on the package of beans will be able to use our model. By meliorating user experience and lower entry barriers, Cyber Barista bears the potential to enlarge the coffee market to an unprecedented level.
